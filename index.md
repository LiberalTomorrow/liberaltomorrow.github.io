Liberal Tomorrow is a loose group of activists looking to help [candidates for
state and local office]({% link candidates.md %}) win their elections.

Rather than donate to big campaigns, like President or Senate, we instead
recommend donations to smaller state and local races. While $100 doesn't make
a big difference to a presidential campaign, it could make the difference in a
city council race, flipping the city from anti-growth to pro-growth.

Liberal Tomorrow isnâ€™t a PAC or SuperPAC. Instead, it is a listing of
[Neoliberal](https://neoliberalproject.org/about-us) and [YIMBY](https://yimbyaction.org/about/)
friendly candidates and their small dollar donation pages. You get to decide
which candidates closest align with your priorities and donate directly to
them.

# Contributing

The main way to contribute is by [donating to our vetted candidates](https://liberaltomorrow.com/candidates).

If you'd like to help find candidates or develop our technical infrastructure,
send us an email at [Team@LiberalTomorrow.com](mailto:Team@LiberalTomorrow.com)
or DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LiberalTomorrow).

We will soon have a questionnaire to share with candidates. Stay tuned.
