# Liberal Tomorrow

Liberal Tomorrow is a loose group of activists looking to help candidates for
state and local office win their elections.

Rather than donate to big campaigns, like President or Senate, we instead
recommend donations to smaller state and local races. While $100 doesn't make
a big difference to a presidential campaign, it could make the difference in a
city council race, flipping the city from anti-growth to pro-growth.

Liberal Tomorrow isnâ€™t a PAC or SuperPAC. Instead, it is a listing of
[Neoliberal](https://neoliberalproject.org/about-us) and [YIMBY](https://yimbyaction.org/about/)
friendly candidates and their small dollar donation pages. You get to decide
which candidates closest align with your priorities and donate directly to
them.

# Contributing

The main way to contribute is by [donating to our vetted candidates](https://liberaltomorrow.com/candidates).
